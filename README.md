## Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews

This project is a web application for analyzing restaurant reviews' sentiments using a machine learning model. Users submit reviews, which are processed and classified as positive or negative by a pre-trained Naive Bayes model. The results are saved to a CSV file, and an analytics page provides insights into the sentiment distribution of the reviews.
